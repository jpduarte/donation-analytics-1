# Data Engineering Coding Challenge

Part of the coding challenge. It does basic part of it: read input, create donor list, and update information of repeated donors, output file contains repeated donors.

Next step is to do extra analysis to finish the challenge.  Also apply constrains to check if input is valid.

Disclaimer: I code this program in a small window of time I have this morning before leaving conference. Basically I did it to show I have the skills to get into the program. I have been in two big conferences last and this week as a part of my last work for my PhD. Thanks for the understanding!
